2011-Apr-02 Added a Zip transformer and a simple Spring Integration route that 
            polls a directory for files, zips them up and transfers them via FTP
            to a remote FTP server (uses embedded FTP server).  
2011-Apr-03 Created a distribution package using the 'maven-assembly-plugin' and 
            the 'maven-shade-plugin'
